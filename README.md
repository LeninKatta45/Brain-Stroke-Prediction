# Brain Stroke Prediction
[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/LeninKatta45/Brain-Stroke-Prediction/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LeninKatta45/Brain-Stroke-Prediction/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Overview

**Brain Stroke Prediction** is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke based on patient data. The solution leverages a Gradient Boosting model along with SMOTE to address class imbalance issues and improve prediction accuracy. The project also features a web interface for ease of use, supported by an AWS infrastructure for scalability.

## Key Features

- **Gradient Boosting Model:** A high-performance model for stroke prediction.
- **SMOTE Implementation:** Balances imbalanced data to improve model generalization.
- **Web Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use web interface for predictions.
- **AWS Deployment:** Scalable cloud deployment using AWS services.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions.

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 94%
- **Data Balancing:** SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting), Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask, FastAPI
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
